# Linux Troubleshooting

## "USE" Method

- **U**tilization: How busy is the resource?
- **S**aturation: How much extra work is waiting or queued?
- **E**rrors: Is there anything that's failing or producing errors?

## Basic System Stats

- **Check uptime** (how long the system has been running) with:
  - `uptime`
  - `top`
  - `w`

## Additional Helpful Tips

- **Uptime/Load Averages**:

  - Use `uptime` or `top` to see load averages. Compare the load average to the number of CPU cores:
    - If load average exceeds core count regularly, you may have saturation issues.

- **Check CPU vs. I/O Bound**:

  - If CPU usage is consistently high, you might be CPU-bound.
  - If the CPU usage is low but load is high, you might be I/O-bound. Check disk or network usage.

- **Monitoring Memory**:

  - `free -h` (the `-h` shows values in human-readable format).
  - Check swap usage to see if the system is under memory pressure.
  - Use `smem` or `pmap` to further dissect which processes use the most memory.

- **Monitoring Disk I/O**:

  - `iostat -x 1` (the `-x` option shows extended stats, the `1` runs it repeatedly).
  - Check metrics like `await` (average wait time in milliseconds for I/O operations).
  - If `await` or `%util` is high, disk saturation might be an issue.

- **Network Diagnostics**:

  - `mtr` for continuous latency/traceroute analysis.
  - `iftop` or `nethogs` for real-time bandwidth usage.
  - `ss -tulnp` to see listening ports (`-t` for TCP, `-u` for UDP, `-l` for listening, `-n` for numeric, `-p` for process).

- **Check Logs**:

  - Don't forget to look at logs under `/var/log/` (for example, `tail -f /var/log/syslog` or `dmesg`) to see error messages and timestamps related to problems.

- **Historical Metrics**:

  - Tools like `sar` (part of the `sysstat` package) can show you performance data from the past day(s).
  - This is invaluable when diagnosing issues that occurred at specific times.

- **Automation & Alerting**:

  - Consider using monitoring platforms (e.g., Nagios, Zabbix, Prometheus, Grafana) to capture key metrics over time and alert you if thresholds are reached.

Unlike some other tools (for example, `nc`/`netcat`, `nmap`, or specific TCP Ping utilities), **fping** is strictly for sending ICMP echo requests (pinging) to the host/IP. This means if you give it `alexflux.com:443` or `8.8.8.8:443`, it will interpret the entire string as a hostname, which doesn't exist---hence the "nodename nor servname provided" error.

If you want to verify basic connectivity (like a regular ping) to `alexflux.com` or `8.8.8.8`, you'd simply use:

bash

CopyEdit

`fping alexflux.com
fping 8.8.8.8`

**But**, if you specifically want to check whether port **443** (HTTPS) is reachable on a host, you'll need a different command or tool altogether. Here are a few options:

1.  **Netcat (nc)**:

    bash

    CopyEdit

    `nc -vz alexflux.com 443`

    - The `-v` flag makes it verbose (so it tells you more), and the `-z` flag just checks if the port is open without sending data.

2.  **Nmap** (Network Mapper):

    bash

    CopyEdit

    `nmap -p 443 alexflux.com`

    - This will scan port 443 on the domain. Nmap is more feature-rich for network diagnostics.

3.  **telnet**:

    bash

    CopyEdit

    `telnet alexflux.com 443`

    - This will try to open a telnet connection on port 443. If it connects, you'll see some kind of handshake prompt or a blinking cursor. If it fails, you'll know the port is blocked or closed.

4.  **curl** (if checking HTTPS connectivity):

    bash

    CopyEdit

    `curl -I https://alexflux.com`

    - This will attempt to connect over port 443 using HTTPS and show you the HTTP headers returned. If there is no service listening on 443 or the connection is blocked, you'll see an error.

---

### TL;DR

- **fping** does not support port specification in the syntax `host:port`.
- To ping at the ICMP level, drop the `:443`.
- To specifically check port 443 connectivity, use `nc -vz host 443`, `nmap -p 443 host`, or similar.

I hope this helps clarify things, Alex! If you have any more questions about checking connectivity or ports, feel free to ask---happy to keep guiding you along!

##### You said:

what are some tcp ping utilitis?

ChatGPT

Thought about TCP ping utilities for 4 seconds

Hey Alex, great question! While standard "ping" (including fping) only uses ICMP echo requests, a "TCP ping" utility tries to establish a TCP connection (often on a specified port) to confirm that the port is open and reachable. Here are some popular tools you can check out:

---

## 1\. **tcping**

- **Platforms:** Primarily Windows (though there are some community builds for Linux).
- **Usage Example (Windows):**

  powershell

  CopyEdit

  `tcping google.com 443`

  This will attempt to do a TCP "ping" (a connection attempt) on port 443 to `google.com`. You'll see connection statistics for that specific TCP port.

---

## 2\. **hping3**

- **Platforms:** Linux/Unix (though it can be built for other platforms).
- **Usage Example:**

  bash

  CopyEdit

  `sudo hping3 -S -p 443 google.com`

  - `-S` sends an SYN packet, `-p 443` targets port 443.
  - Hping3 can do a lot more than just TCP pings---it can craft customized packets, test firewalls, perform traceroutes, etc.

---

## 3\. **nmap** (Using TCP SYN Ping or TCP Connect)

While **nmap** is typically known for port scanning, you can do a form of TCP "ping":

bash

CopyEdit

`nmap -Pn -p 443 --host_timeout 2000 --max-retries 0 google.com`

- `-Pn` tells **nmap** not to do the default ICMP ping first.
- `-p 443` checks port 443.
- You can add or adjust other options for faster checking or more details.

Alternatively, for a simple connect test:

bash

CopyEdit

`nmap -p 443 --script=tcp-connect google.com`

This uses the `tcp-connect` script to verify if port 443 is open.

---

## 4\. **nc (netcat)**

Netcat can do a quick TCP port check:

bash

CopyEdit

`nc -vz google.com 443`

- `-v` for verbose output.
- `-z` means "don't send data, just check if we can open a TCP connection."\
  If successful, it'll say "Connection succeeded," if not, it'll time out or show "Connection refused."

While not strictly labeled a "TCP ping" program, netcat is often used for this purpose because it's readily available on many systems.

---

## 5\. **nping** (part of the Nmap suite)

**nping** is a command-line tool included with Nmap. It lets you do various packet-based pings. For a TCP ping:

bash

CopyEdit

`nping --tcp -p 443 google.com`

You can also fine-tune packet size, flags, and more.

---

## 6\. **paping** (Port Pinging)

- **Platforms:** Windows, Linux (via third-party ports).
- **Usage Example:**

  bash

  CopyEdit

  `paping google.com -p 443`

  This will show you a series of attempts to connect on port 443 and how long each attempt took.

---

### Tips

- **Install:** Most of these tools don't come pre-installed on all systems. On Debian/Ubuntu, for example, you might run `sudo apt-get install hping3 nmap netcat` or similar. On Windows, you often download `.exe` installers or use **chocolatey** / **winget**.
- **Ports:** If you don't specify a port, tools like `nc`, `tcping`, etc. generally won't do anything meaningful (they need that port for a TCP handshake).
- **Privileges:** Some tools may require running as root or Administrator if sending raw packets (like hping3 with SYN packets).
