# Performing a TCP Traceroute on an Arista Switch Running EOS

## Overview

In certain network environments, ICMP traffic used by standard traceroute may be blocked or filtered. To overcome this, you can perform a TCP-based traceroute directly from an Arista switch running EOS. This method utilizes the underlying Linux shell to execute a TCP traceroute, providing insights into the route taken by TCP packets.

## Steps to Perform TCP Traceroute

1. **Access the Bash Shell on the Arista Switch**

   Enter the Bash shell from the EOS CLI:

   ```bash
   bash
   ```

1. Execute the TCP Traceroute

   Use the `traceroute` command with the `-T` option to specify TCP mode. For example, to trace the route to `console.signiant.com` over TCP port 80:

   ```bash
   sudo traceroute -T console.signiant.com
   ```

   The `-T` flag indicates the use of TCP SYN packets for tracerouting, with the default destination port being 80.

1. Specify a Different TCP Port (Optional)

   If you need to trace to a different TCP port, use the `-p` option followed by the desired port number. For instance, to use port 443:

   ```bash
   sudo traceroute -T -p 443 console.signiant.com
   ```

## Important Notes

- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to execute these commands on the Arista switch.
- Be cautious when using `sudo` to avoid unintended system changes.
- This method is particularly useful when ICMP traffic is blocked or filtered in the network path, as TCP traceroute can provide alternative insights.

## Using UDP Traceroute

In addition to TCP traceroute, you can also perform a UDP-based traceroute. This can be useful in scenarios where both ICMP and TCP traffic are filtered or blocked.

1. **Execute the UDP Traceroute**

   Use the `traceroute` command with the default settings to perform a UDP traceroute. For example, to trace the route to `console.signiant.com`:

   ```bash
   sudo traceroute console.signiant.com
   ```

   By default, the `traceroute` command sends UDP packets.

1. Specify a Different UDP Port (Optional)

   If you need to trace to a specific UDP port, use the `-p` option followed by the desired port number. For instance, to use port 33434:

   ```bash
   sudo traceroute -p 33434 console.signiant.com
   ```

## Important Notes for UDP Traceroute

- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to execute these commands on the Arista switch.
- Be cautious when using `sudo` to avoid unintended system changes.
- UDP traceroute can be useful when both ICMP and TCP traffic are blocked or filtered, providing another method to trace the network path.
