What Are RFCs?
RFCs (Requests for Comments) are the official publications of the IETF, documenting everything from protocol standards to best current practices and informational memos for the Internet community.
IETF
They are freely available via the IETF Datatracker and RFC Editor sites, and are the normative source for how networked systems interoperate.

Core Internet Protocols
IPv4, ICMP, TCP, ARP, DNS
RFC 791: Internet Protocol (IPv4) defines the packet format and header semantics for IPv4, the backbone of Internet addressing.

RFC 792: Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) specifies ICMP for diagnostics (e.g., ping) and error reporting.
Wikipedia

RFC 793: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) describes TCP’s reliable, ordered, connection‑oriented transport service.
Wikipedia

RFC 826: Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) maps IPv4 addresses to Ethernet MAC addresses on local networks.

Security Protocols
Transport Layer Security (TLS)
RFC 2246: TLS 1.0 introduced the first version of TLS, building on SSL to secure communications.
Wikipedia

RFC 5246: TLS 1.2 enhanced TLS with new cipher suites and improved security features.
Wikipedia

RFC 8446: TLS 1.3 is the current TLS standard focused on performance optimizations, forward secrecy, and improved privacy.

Secure Shell (SSH)
RFC 4251: SSH Protocol Architecture lays out the layered design of SSH‑2 for secure remote login, command execution, and tunneling.
IETF Datatracker

IPv6 and IPsec
RFC 4291: IPv6 Addressing Architecture defines the IPv6 address formats and allocation guidelines for the next‑generation Internet Protocol.
Wikipedia

RFC 4301: IPsec Security Architecture specifies IPsec’s architecture for authenticating and encrypting IP packets to secure VPNs and site‑to‑site links.

Network Management and Automation
RFC 2131: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) automates IP address assignment and network configuration for hosts.
Wikipedia

RFC 1157 & RFC 3411–3418: SNMPv1 & SNMPv3 define the Simple Network Management Protocol frameworks for monitoring, configuration, and security of network devices.
Wikipedia

Best Current Practices and Informational RFCs
RFC 2119: Key Words for Requirement Levels establishes must/should/may terminology for indicating requirement levels in technical specifications.
Wikipedia

RFC 2196: Site Security Handbook provides comprehensive guidelines for developing organizational security policies and incident response procedures.
Security Boulevard

RFC 2504: Users’ Security Handbook offers practical security advice for end‑users, such as “Encrypt Everything… Shred Everything Else.”
Security Boulevard

RFC 6274: Security Assessment of IPv4 analyzes IPv4’s security posture and known vulnerabilities as of 2011.
Security Boulevard

RFC 9110: HTTP Semantics standardizes the core semantics of HTTP across all versions, critical for web security and monitoring.

Further Reading & Fun RFCs
RFC 1925: The Twelve Networking Truths is an entertaining yet insightful memo documenting fundamental truths of networking (e.g., “It is more complicated than you think”).
RFC Editor

April Fools’ RFCs (e.g., RFC 1149: IP over Avian Carriers) illustrate the lighter side of Internet standards.
