# MPLS (Multi Protocol Label Switching)

- MPLS is a protocol that is used to speed up the traffic flow in a
  network. It is a mechanism that allows the network to direct data
  packets from one node to the next based on short path labels rather
  than long network addresses, avoiding complex lookups in a routing
  table. The labels identify virtual links (paths) between distant nodes rather than endpoints.
  MPLS can encapsulate packets of various network protocols.
  MPLS operates at an OSI Model layer that is generally considered to lie between traditional definitions
  of Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) and Layer 3 (Network Layer), and thus is often referred to as a "Layer 2.5" protocol.

BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)

- BGP is a standardized exterior gateway protocol designed to exchange
  routing and reachability information among autonomous systems (AS) on
  the Internet. The protocol is classified as a path vector protocol.
  The Border Gateway Protocol makes routing decisions based on paths,
  network policies, or rule-sets configured by a network administrator
  and is involved in making core routing decisions. BGP may be used for
  routing within an autonomous system. In this application,
  it is referred to as Interior Border Gateway Protocol, Internal BGP, or iBGP.

VPN (Virtual Private Network)

- A virtual private network (VPN) extends a private network across a
  public network and enables users to send and receive data across
  shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly
  connected to the private network. Applications running across a VPN
  may therefore benefit from the functionality, security, and management
  of the private network.

- VPNs replace dedicated point-to-point links with emulated point-to-point links.
  VPNs are used to secure connections between remote users and the corporate network,
  secure connections between remote offices and the corporate network, and secure connections
  between remote offices and remote offices.

- Examples of VPNs include:
