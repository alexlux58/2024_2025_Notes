  Your Company is Audited ----> Your Customers Request the Report

# Why this Matters

- The AICPA owns the SOC 2 standard
- Your auditor must be a CPA Firm
- Ensure the CPA firm specializes in SOC 2 audits

# SOC 2 Scoping

- 5 trust service criteria
- The System being audited

## Trust Service Criteria

- Security (Common Criteria)
- Availability
- Processing Integrity (everything in the audited system is complete, valid, accurate, timely and authorized to fully satisfy the entity's objectives)
- Confidentiality (sets three core objectives that define how organizations identify, protect, and dispose of data)
- Privacy ( Focuses on core privacy principles: Notice, Choice and Consent, Collection, Retention and disposal, access, disclosure to third parties, quality, and monitoring and enforcement)

## System in Scope

- You have some flexibility here
- Needs to be applicable to the reader of the report

### Typically Includes:

- Application, Product, or Service
- People
- Locations
- Technology Stack
- Supporting Corporate Systems (Network, Email, HR, Legal)

# 4 Step SOC 2 Process

- Gap Assessment
- Remediation
- SOC2 Type 1 Report
- SOC2 Type 2 Report

# SOC 2 Type 1 vs Type 2

## SOC 2 Type 1: Point in Time

- Usually just your first year
- Let's you get a report in hand faster
- Good first run of a real audit
- Not required

## SOC 2 Type 2: Covers an Audit Period

- Covers an audit period
- This is what you will get every year

# SOC 2: Typical Timeline (First Year)

## Timeline Overview

| Month     | Activity                       |
| --------- | ------------------------------ |
| Jan - Feb | **Gap Assessment**             |
| Jan - May | **Correct Issues**             |
| May       | **SOC 2 Type I Report**        |
| May - Jan | **SOC 2 Type II Audit Period** |
| Oct       | **Planning**                   |
| Nov       | **Audit Fieldwork**            |
| Dec       | **SOC 2 Type II Report**       |

---

## Notes

- **SOC 2 Type I** evaluates controls at a specific point in time.

- **SOC 2 Type II** assesses the operating effectiveness of those controls over a period (typically 3-6 months).

- The **Gap Assessment** phase is crucial to identify deficiencies before the audit period begins.

- The **Planning** and **Audit Fieldwork** phases finalize the audit before the Type II report is issued.

# SOC 2: Typical Timeline (Year 2 and Beyond)

## Timeline Overview

| Month     | Activity                         |
| --------- | -------------------------------- |
| Jan - Aug | **You Maintaining Your Program** |
| Jan - Dec | **SOC 2 Type II Audit Period**   |
| Sep       | **Planning**                     |
| Oct - Nov | **Audit Fieldwork**              |
| Dec       | **SOC 2 Type II Report**         |

---

## Notes

- Year 2 focuses on **maintaining your controls and processes** throughout the year.

- The **audit period** still spans several months and culminates in another **Type II report**.

- Continuous improvement and readiness are key in Year 2 and beyond.

- Activities like **vulnerability scanning**, **security awareness training**, and **access reviews** are examples of ongoing controls to maintain.
