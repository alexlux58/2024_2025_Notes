Prompt Example (for ChatGPT-5):

You are my content strategist.
Goal: I am building my brand as a future DevSecOps engineer → CTO.
Audience: Tech professionals, aspiring engineers, security/DevOps learners.
Platforms: LinkedIn (educational, professional), Twitter/X (short insights), Instagram/TikTok Reels (punchy, engaging), LinkedIn carousel posts.
Tone: Clear, educational, a bit motivational, professional but approachable.
Task:

Generate 5 content ideas around [insert today’s topic, e.g. “container security basics” or “what is zero trust”].

For each idea, create:

A hook/headline

A LinkedIn post (150–250 words)

A Twitter/X version (under 280 chars)

A Reel/TikTok script (30–45 seconds, conversational tone)

Hashtags (SEO optimized, 6–10 per platform).

Make the content consistent in voice so it feels like my personal brand.

Suggest 1–2 visual ideas I can design in Canva (e.g., diagram, code snippet overlay, infographic).

Deliver in a clean, structured format I can copy/paste.

Pro Tips for Consistency

Lock in your brand voice – every prompt should remind GPT of your tone (educational + professional + approachable).

Batch create – pick one theme per week (e.g., Kubernetes, IAM, OWASP Top 10) and generate a full content pack in one run.

Create templates in Canva/CapCut – so visuals always look consistent with your “brand colors/fonts.”

Iterate – after 2–3 weeks, check which style gets best engagement → refine the prompt accordingly.
