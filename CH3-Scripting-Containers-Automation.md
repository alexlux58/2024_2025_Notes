A. until
B. do
C. for
D. foreach

<details>
<summary style="color: red;">Answer</summary>

C. for

**Explanation:**
The for loop should be used for this purpose because it iterates through a list. An until loop would require additional code, thus
making it a less-preferable construct for the purpose described. There is no do loop or foreach loop in Bash, thus making those options incorrect.

</details>

---

D. The command will execute and send all output to /dev/null.

<details>
<summary style="color: red;">Answer</summary>

C. The command will execute as if the $() command substitution was used.

**Explanation:**
Command substitution can be accomplished using backquotes or $(). These two methods are substantially but not completely equivalent. The backquote method is older and is less flexible than the $() method. The backquote method is still used in many scripts, but the $() method is more common in modern scripts.

B. mysql | customers.sql
C. mysql > customers.sql
mysql >< customers.sql

<details>
<summary style="color: red;">Answer</summary>

A. mysql < customers.sql

**Explanation:**
In this scenario, STDIN redirection is accomplished with a less-than sign to take the contents of customers.sql and send those contents into the mysql command. It's also likely that the mysql command would have things like -u for the username and -p to prompt for the password, but those were not relevant to the scenario and are not required in all circumstances. The other options shown are not valid for the purpose described. Options B and C take output from the mysql command, while option D is an invalid character sequence.

### Question 55

You have received a file that does not have a file extension. Which command can you run to help determine what type of file it might be?

A. grep
B. telnet
C. file
D. export

<details>
<summary style="color: red;">Answer</summary>

C. file

**Explanation:**
The file command can be used to determine which type of file is being used. This can be particularly helpful for files without extensions, where you are unsure if you should view the contents of the file. Option A, grep, is used to look within files but would not be helpful in this case. Option B, telnet, is used for remote connections and would not be helpful in this case. Option D, export, is used to add variables to the environment and would not be helpful in this case.

**Example:**

```bash
file my_file
```
