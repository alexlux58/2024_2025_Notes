### System Operations and Maintenance

### Question 1

You need to delete a user from the system, including their home directory. Which of the following utility commands accomplishes this task?

A. userdel
B. userdel -r
C. userdel -R
D. deluser

<details>
<summary style="color: red;">Answer</summary>

B. userdel -r

**Explanation:**
The userdel command is used for this purpose, and the -r option (lowercase) deletes both the home directory and mail spool files. The -R (uppercase) option informs the userdel command to use a chroot directory, which is not relevant in this context. The deluser command is not standard across all Linux distributions, making it less reliable for this specific task.

**Example:**
To delete the user "alex" along with their home directory, you would use:

```bash
userdel -r alex
```

</details>

### Question 2

You need to enable the web server (running as the www-data user and group) to write into a directory called /home/webfiles. Which commands will accomplish this task in the most
secure manner?

A. chgrp www-data /home/webfiles; chmod 775 /home/webfiles
B. chmod 777 /home/webfiles
C. chgrp www-data /home/webfiles; chmod 711 /home/webfiles
D. chmod 707 /home/webfiles

<details>
<summary style="color: red;">Answer</summary>

A. chgrp www-data /home/webfiles; chmod 775 /home/webfiles

**Explanation:**
The best option among these choices is to change the group to www-data and change the permissions such that the group can write into the directory. Option B (chmod 777) gives all users write access, which is not secure. Option C (chmod 711) does not allow group write access, and option D (chmod 707) is also insecure as it allows all users read and execute access.

**Example:**
To set the permissions securely, use the following commands:

```bash
chgrp www-data /home/webfiles
chmod 775 /home/webfiles
```

</details>

### Question 3

Assume that passwords must be changed every 60 days. Which command will change the date of the users last password change without the user actually changing the account password?

A. chage -f
B. chage -W
C. chage -l
D. chage -d

<details>
<summary style="color: red;">Answer</summary>

D. chage -d

**Explanation:**
The chage command is used for this purpose. The -d option sets the days since the last password change and is measured in days since January 1, 1970. The -W option is the days of warning for changing a password, and the -l option displays a list of the various settings related to the account. There is no -f option for the chage command.

**Example:**
To set the last password change date to today for a user named "alex," you would use:

```bash
chage -d 0 alex
```

</details>

---

### Question 4

What is the order in which user configuration files are located on login to a Bash shell?

A. .bash_login, .profile, /etc/profile
B. .bash_profile, .bash_login, .profile
C. .profile, .bash_login, .bash_profile
D. .bash_login, .bash_profile, .profile

<details>
<summary style="color: red;">Answer</summary>

B. .bash_profile, .bash_login, .profile

**Explanation:**
When a user logs into a Bash shell, the shell looks for configuration files in the following order: .bash_profile, .bash_login, and then .profile. If none of these files are found, it will then look for the global configuration file /etc/profile. The other options do not reflect the correct order.

**Example:**
If you have all three configuration files in your home directory (.bash_profile, .bash_login, and .profile), they will be sourced in this order:

- .bash_profile
- .bash_login
- .profile

</details>

---

### Question 5

Within which directory should you place files to have them automatically copied to a user's home directory when the user is created.

A. /etc/userhome
B. /etc/templateuser
C. /etc/skel
D. /home/skel

<details>
<summary style="color: red;">Answer</summary>

C. /etc/skel

**Explanation:**
The /etc/skel directory contains files to be copied to the user's home directory. The other directories listed for this question do not exist or are not used for this purpose in standard Linux distributions.

**Example:**
Place template files in /etc/skel, and they will automatically copy to any new userâ€™s home directory upon creation.

</details>

---

### Question 6

Which bash parameter or option will cause the shell to be executed without reading the initialization files?

A. --no-rc
B. --no-init
C. --norc
D. --rc-none

<details>
<summary style="color: red;">Answer</summary>

C. --norc

**Explanation:**
The --norc option causes bash to execute without reading the /etc/bash.bashrc (Debian derivatives) or /etc/bashrc (Red Hat derivatives) file or the local ~/.bashrc file. The other options do not exist or are not valid for this purpose.

**Example:**
To open a new bash session without reading initialization files, you would use:

```bash
bash --norc
```

</details>

---

### Question 7

You need to create a function that will be available each time you log in to the system. Within which file should this function be placed?

A. .bash_profile
B. .rc
C. /etc/profile
D. .bash_run

<details>
<summary style="color: red;">Answer</summary>

A. .bash_profile

**Explanation:**
The .bash_profile file, if it exists in your home directory, will be executed on login. Note that placing the function in /etc/profile would technically work, but then the function would be available to all users, not just the individual user. The other options are not standard files for this purpose.

**Example:**
Add a function in your .bash_profile file, for example:

```bash
myfunction() { echo "Hello, world!"; }
```

</details>

### Question 8

Assuming X forwarding has been enabled on the SSH server, which environment variable is used to set the location for newly spawned windows from within an SSH session?

A. DISPLAY
B. XTERMINAL
C. XTERM
D. XDISP

<details>
<summary style="color: red;">Answer</summary>

A. DISPLAY

**Explanation:**
The DISPLAY variable can be used to remotely send the window of an X session to another computer when using protocols like SSH.
There is no XTERMINAL or XDISP environment variable, and XTERM is typically a terminal window and not an environment variable.

**Example:**
Set the DISPLAY variable to direct GUI applications to another system:

```bash
export DISPLAY=remote_ip:0.0
```

</details>

---

### Question 9

Which of the following options in the SSH configuration file needs to be enabled so that X sessions can be sent over an SSH connection?

A. X11Connect yes
B. X11Forwarding yes
C. ForwardX yes
D. XForward yes

<details>
<summary style="color: red;">Answer</summary>

B. X11Forwarding yes

**Explanation:**
The X11Forwarding option must be enabled in order for X connections or windows generated from the X server to be sent over an SSH connection. The other options listed are not valid configuration options in the SSH configuration file.

**Example:**
To enable X11 forwarding, edit the SSH configuration file (/etc/ssh/sshd_config) and add:

```bash
X11Forwarding yes
```

</details>

### Question 10

Which file contains user information such as username and real name and is readable by all users of the system?

A. /etc/pass
B. /etc/shadow
C. /etc/passwd
D. /etc/userinfo

<details>
<summary style="color: red;">Answer</summary>

C. /etc/passwd

**Explanation:**
The /etc/passwd file contains various information about users on a system such as username and real name, along with user ID (UID) and login shell. The file is world-readable. The /etc/shadow file
contains encrypted passwords but is not readable by all users. The other two files shown as options do not exist by default in standard Linux distributions.

**Example:**
To view information about users in the system, you can read the contents of /etc/passwd:

```bash
cat /etc/passwd
```

</details>

---

### Question 11

Which of the following commands changes a group called DomainAdmins to DomainUsers?

A. groupmod -n DomainUsers DomainAdmins
B. groupchg DomainAdmins DomainUsers
C. chgroup DomainAdmins DomainUsers
D. group -N DomainAdmins DomainUsers

<details>
<summary style="color: red;">Answer</summary>

A. groupmod -n DomainUsers DomainAdmins

**Explanation:**
The groupmod command is used for this purpose, and the -n option is used to change the group name. The other commands listed do not exist or are not valid for this purpose.

**Example:**
To rename the group "DomainAdmins" to "DomainUsers," use:

```bash
groupmod -n DomainUsers DomainAdmins
```

</details>

---

### Question 12

When running useradd, which option needs to be specified in order for the user's home directory to be created?

A. -h
B. -m
C. -x
D. -a

<details>
<summary style="color: red;">Answer</summary>

B. -m

**Explanation:**
The -m option causes the user's home directory to be created. By default, if this option isn't specified and CREATE_HOME has not been set, the home directory won't be created.
The -h option displays help text, and the other options shown do not exist or are not valid for this purpose.

**Example:**
To create a user with a home directory, use the -m option like this:

```bash
useradd -m username
```

</details>

---

### Question 13

Which of the following commands locks out password-based login for a user but does not prevent other forms of login?

A. usermod -L
B. userdel -r
C. useradd -h
D. userlock

<details>
<summary style="color: red;">Answer</summary>

A. usermod -L

**Explanation:**
The usermod -L command locks an account by placing an ! in the encrypted password. If the user has another means to log in, such as with an SSH key, using usermod -L will not prevent their login.
Among the other answers, userdel -r deletes a user and useradd -h displays help related to adding a user to the system. There is no userlock command.

**Example:**
To lock password-based login for a user named "alex" while keeping other access methods intact,

```bash
usermod -L alex
```

</details>

---

### Question 14

Which of the following commands produces a report listing the last password change date for all users on the system?

A. passwd -a
B. passwd -S
C. passwd -a -S
D. passwd --all

<details>
<summary style="color: red;">Answer</summary>

C. passwd -a -S

**Explanation:**
The passwd command will be used for this purpose. The -a option displays all users but requires the use of -S to indicate status. The -S option alone will not produce a report for all users,
and the --all option is an alias for -a. Therefore, the correct combination is -a -S.

**Example:**
To display the last password change date for all users, use:

```bash
passwd -a -S
```

</details>

---

### Question 15

Which file contains a list of usernames, UIDs, and encrypted passwords?

A. /etc/passwd
B. /etc/shadow
C. /etc/encpass
D. /etc/grouppass

<details>
<summary style="color: red;">Answer</summary>

B. /etc/shadow

**Explanation:**
The /etc/shadow file contains user account information, including usernames, UIDs, and encrypted passwords. This file is not readable by all users for security reasons.
The /etc/passwd file contains user information but does not store encrypted passwords. The other two files listed do not exist in standard Linux distributions.

**Example:**
To view encrypted password information for users, check the contents of /etc/shadow with:

```bash
sudo cat /etc/shadow
```

</details>

---

### Question 16

Which command is used to change a user's home directory to /srv/data/username and move the contents at the same time?

A. usermod -d /srv/data/username -m
B. homedir -m /srv/data/username
C. userex -m /srv/data/username
D. userchg /m /srv/data/username -d

<details>
<summary style="color: red;">Answer</summary>

A. usermod -d /srv/data/username -m

**Explanation:**
The usermod command is used for this purpose. The -d option changes the home directory from its normal location at /home. The -m option moves the contents.
The other commands shown for this question are not valid.

**Example:**
To change a userâ€™s home directory and move existing files, use:

```bash
usermod -d /srv/data/username -m username
```

</details>

---

### Question 17

Which option to useradd will add groups for a user?

A. -g
B. -x
C. -l
D. -G

<details>
<summary style="color: red;">Answer</summary>

D. -G

**Explanation:**
The -G option is a list of supplemental groups to which the user will be added. A lowercase -g option provides the primary GID. The -l option causes the user to not be added
to the lastlog and faillog databases. There is no -x option.

**Example:**
To add a user to supplementary groups, use -G as follows:

```bash
useradd -G group1,group2 username
```

</details>

---

### Question 18

Which option to useradd creates a system user rather than a normal user?

A. -r
B. -s
C. -a
D. -S

<details>
<summary style="color: red;">Answer</summary>

A. -r

**Explanation:**
The -r option creates a system user, which will typically entail no expiration, no home directory, and a UID below 1000. The -s option defines
the user's shell, while the -a option is not valid for useradd. The -S option does not exist.

**Example:**
To create a system user, run:

```bash
useradd -r username
```

</details>

---

### Question 19

Which file contains encrypted password information for groups?

A. /etc/group
B. /etc/gshadow
C. /etc/gsecure
D. /etc/group.conf

<details>
<summary style="color: red;">Answer</summary>

B. /etc/gshadow

**Explanation:**
The /etc/gshadow file contains secure information such as an encrypted password for groups, where applicable. The /etc/group file contains general information
on groups. The other two files listed as options do not exist.

**Example:**
To view group password information, check the /etc/gshadow file:

```bash
sudo cat /etc/gshadow
```

</details>

---

### Question 20

Which of the following best describes a valid use of the groupdel command?

A. You may force group deletion with the -f option.
B. If a user's primary group is to be deleted, that user must be deleted first or have their primary group changed.
C. Groupdel can be run at any time, regardless of group membership.
D. The -r option for groupdel will recursively change users' GIDs after group deletion.

<details>
<summary style="color: red;">Answer</summary>

B. If a user's primary group is to be deleted, that user must be deleted first or have their primary group changed.

**Explanation:**
The groupdel command cannot delete groups unless there are no users who have the given group as their primary GID. Therefore, option B best fits the scenario.
There is no -f or -r option, making options A and D incorrect. Option C is also incorrect because groupdel cannot be run if there are users with that group as their primary group.

**Example:**
If you need to delete a group that is a userâ€™s primary group, first change the userâ€™s primary group or delete the user before running:

```bash
groupdel groupname
```

</details>

---

### Question 21

Which of the following commands displays the UID, primary group, and supplemental groups for a given user?

A. id
B. getid
C. passwd
D. chage

<details>
<summary style="color: red;">Answer</summary>

A. id

**Explanation:**
The id command shows the username, UID, primary group, and GID along with supplemental groups. The passwd and chage commands are not used for this purpose. There is no getid command.

**Example:**
To display the UID, primary group, and supplemental groups for a user named "alex," you would use:

```bash
id alex
```

</details>

---

### Question 22

Which option to the usermod command is used to change a given user's real name?

A. -R
B. -n
C. -d
D. -c

<details>
<summary style="color: red;">Answer</summary>

D. -c

**Explanation:**
The -c option changes the comment field in /etc/passwd. The comment field is typically associated with the real name of the account. The -R option indicates a chroot directory, while -d indicates a change of home directory. There is no -n option.

**Example:**
To change a user's real name to "Alex Lux," you would use:

```bash
usermod -c "Alex Lux" username
```

</details>

---

### Question 23

A user needs to work with printers and printer-related items. Which of the following commands adds the user (called username in the options) to the appropriate group for this purpose?

A. usermod -aG printusers username
B. usermod -aG lpadmin username
C. usermod -gA lpadm username
D. usermod -a lpadm username

<details>
<summary style="color: red;">Answer</summary>

B. usermod -aG lpadmin username

**Explanation:**
The usermod command with the -aG option is used to append a group onto the user's list of groups.
In this case, the user needs to be a member of hte lpadmin group. The other options are incorrect in their syntax or group names.

**Example:**
To add a user named "alex" to the lpadmin group, you would use:

```bash
usermod -aG lpadmin alex
```

</details>

---

### Question 24

You need to examine who is currently logged in to the system. Which of the following commands will display this information?

A. listuser
B. fuser
C. ls -u
D. w

<details>
<summary style="color: red;">Answer</summary>

D. w

**Explanation:**
The w command shows currently logged-in users along with information such as uptime and load average and is similar to the who command.
The fuser command is used to show open files, and the -u option to ls controls the display for file listings. There is no listuser command.

**Example:**
To see who is currently logged in to the system, you would use:

```bash
w
```

</details>

---

### Question 25

Within the following entry in /etc/shadow, to what does the number 15853 refer?
mail:\*:15835:0:99999:7:::

A. The UID of the mail user
B. The number of files owned by mail
C. The date of the last password change (since 1/1/1970)
D. The number of days until the account expires

<details>
<summary style="color: red;">Answer</summary>

C. The date of the last password change (since 1/1/1970)

**Explanation:**
The date of the password change, as measured in days since January 1, 1970, is contained in the hird field of a shadow entry. The expiration date would be the eighth field,
as separated by colons. The UID is not stored in /etc/shadow, and the other options are incorrect.

**Example:**
To view the date of the last password change for the user "mail," you would use:

```bash
chage -l mail
```

</details>

---

### Question 26

Which of the best describes the relationship between UIDs and GIDs on a Linux system when an authentication server is being configured?

A. whois
B. who
C. loggedin
D. curusers

<details>
<summary style="color: red;">Answer</summary>

A. whois

**Explanation:**
The who command displays who is currently logged in and the date and time they logged in. The whois command displays information about domains.
The other commands are not valid in this context.

**Example:**
To see who is currently logged in to the system, you would use:

```bash
who
```

</details>

---

### Question 27

Which of the following commands adds a group?

A. groupadd
B. addgrp
C. grpadd
D. creategroup

<details>
<summary style="color: red;">Answer</summary>

A. groupadd

**Explanation:**
The groupadd command is used to create a new group. The other options listed do not exist or are not valid commands for this purpose.

**Example:**
To add a new group named "developers," you would use:

```bash
groupadd developers
```

</details>

---

### Question 28

Which of the following commands enables the sticky bit for a user on a file called homescript.sh?

A. chmod +sticky homescript.sh
B. chmod 755 homescript.sh
C. chmod u+t homescript.sh
D. chown u+sticky homescript.sh

<details>
<summary style="color: red;">Answer</summary>

C. chmod u+t homescript.sh

**Explanation:**
The sticky bit is set using +t. For this question, the user permission is being affected, thus the u as an argument to chmod.
Among the other answers, the chown command is valid but changes ownership, not permissions, and thus isn't used for the purpose described in the question.

**Example:**
To enable the sticky bit for a file called "homescript.sh," you would use:

```bash
chmod u+t homescript.sh
```

</details>

---

### Question 29

The umask reports as 022. What is the permission that will be in effect for a newly non-executable created file?

A. u+rw, g+r, w+r
B. 755
C. 644
D. a+r

<details>
<summary style="color: red;">Answer</summary>

C. 644

**Explanation:**
The umask value of 022 means that the group and others will not have write permissions.
The default permission for a newly created file is 666 (rw-rw-rw-), and when the umask is applied, it results in 644 (rw-r--r--).

**Example:**
To see the current umask value, you would use:

```bash
umask
```

</details>

### Question 30

Which of the following best describes the relationship between UIDs and GIDs on a Linux system when an authentication server is being configured?

A. The UID and GID are the ame across the system for a given user.
B. Each user has a UID and GID that are the same and are created when the user is created.
C. The UID represents the user, while the GID is a globally unique user ID.
D. There is no direct relationship between UID and GID.

<details>
<summary style="color: red;">Answer</summary>

D. There is no direct relationship between UID and GID.

**Explanation:**
There is no direct relationship between the UIDs and GIDs on a system. UIDs represent users, while GIDs represent group IDs.
On some systems, the UID and GID numbers will match for regular users, but this is not a requirement and is more of a coincidence than a rule.

**Example:**
To see the UID and GID for a user named "alex," you would use:

```bash
id alex
```

</details>

### Question 31

When you're configuring a server for SNMP server role, which ports need to be allowed through the firewall for SNMP traffic?

A. Ports 23 and 25
B. Ports 110 and 143
C. Ports 80 and 443
D. Ports 161 and 162

<details>
<summary style="color: red;">Answer</summary>

D. Ports 161 and 162

**Explanation:**
SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) uses UDP ports 161 for general SNMP messages and 162 for SNMP traps.
Although the traffic is usually on UDP, the TCP ports are also reserved for SNMP.
Ports 23 and 25 are used for Telnet and SMTP, respectively. Ports 110 and 143 are used for POP3 and IMAP, while ports 80 and 443 are used for HTTP and HTTPS traffic.

</details>

### Question 32

You need to look at information on logins beyond what was captured by the current log file for the last command.
Which option to the last command can be used to load information from an alternate file?

A. -a
B. -t
C. -e
D. -f

<details>
<summary style="color: red;">Answer</summary>

D. -f

**Explanation:**
Loading of alternate files is accomplished using the -f option.
Doing so facilitates exactly the scenario described: being able to examine logins from old log files.
The -a option controls the location of the display for the host, while -t controls the display to show the logins as of the specified date and time.
The -e option does not exist.

</details>

### Question 33

When creating a certificate authority server role, which of the following commands generates a private key for use with SSL and places it into the file /etc/ssl/example.com.private?

A. openssl genrsa -out /etc/ssl/example.com.private
B. openssl generate-private > /etc/ssl/example.com.private
C. openssl genpriv > /etc/ssl/example.com.private
D. openssh genkey -out /etc/ssl/example.com.private

<details>
<summary style="color: red;">Answer</summary>

A. openssl genrsa -out /etc/ssl/example.com.private

**Explanation:**
The openssl command will be used for this purpose, with the genrsa option. An output file is specified with -ou.
The other commands containing openssl all contain an invalid option. The final command is openssh and is not used for this scenario.

</details>

### Question 45

When sourcing a file in bash, which chmod command would be necessary to provide the minimum privileges in order for the file to be sourced correctly, assuming
that your current user owns the file?

A. chmod 600
B. chmod 755
C. chmod 777
D. chmod 400

<details>
<summary style="color: red;">Answer</summary>

D. chmod 400

**Explanation:**
You minimally need to be able to read the file being sourced; therefore, chmod 400 will correctly set the permissions. Any chmod that gives additional permissions is not necessary.
When permissions are granted using octal notation, the number 4 is read, 2 is write, and 1 is execute. There are three permissions: user (owner), group, and other or world.
Therefore, chmod 400 grants "read" privileges to the owner and no permissions to group and other/ world. This is the minimum necessary to source a file.

D. NONE: 192.168.1/255.255.255.0

<details>
<summary style="color: red;">Answer</summary>

C. ALL: 192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0

**Explanation:**
The syntax to block access to every service uses the ALL keyword followed by the address or network to which the policy will apply. This is important
becuase you may notice attacks coming from certain IP blocks, and blocking with TCP wrappers provides a fast method for effective blocking. The other options are not valid.

**Example:**
To deny access to all services for the network 192.168.1.0/24, add this line in /etc/hosts.deny:

```bash
ALL: 192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0

D. /root/ssh_known_hosts

<details>
<summary style="color: red;">Answer</summary>

B. /etc/ssh_known_hosts

**Explanation:**
The file ssh_known_hosts, usually kept in either /etc/ or /etc/ssh/, is used for the purpose described. Note that on some systems, this file and other SSH-related configurations may be found in /etc/sshd/. The answers that indicated ~ or within /root are incorrect because the question specified a server-wide list. A known_hosts file found within ~/.ssh would indicate the user's home directory. The file /etc/sshd_known_hosts does not exist.

**Example:**
To add a host key to the system-wide known_hosts file, use:

```bash

### Question 79

Which format should the certificate and key be in for a Postfix TLS configuration?

A. PKCS
B. PEM
C. TLS
D. SSL

<details>
<summary style="color: red;">Answer</summary>

B. PEM

**Explanation:**
PEM format is used for public and private keys with a Postfix TLS configuration. The other methods listed are valid cryptographic algorithms or systems but not for the scenario described. As with Sendmail, system administrators should take steps to secure mail servers so that the servers are not used for sending unsolicited email. For many scenarios, a full mail server like Postfix or Sendmail is not required in order to simply relay mail from a server.

**Example:**
To configure Postfix to use a certificate and key in PEM format, add the following lines to the Postfix configuration file:

```bash
smtpd_tls_cert_file = /etc/ssl/certs/server.crt
smtpd_tls_key_file = /etc/ssl/private/server.key

A. REDIRECT
B. PREROUTING
C. PORTREDIR
D. ROUTING

<details>
<summary style="color: red;">Answer</summary>

A. REDIRECT

**Explanation:**
The PREROUTING chain, part of the nat table, contains rules that are applied as packets arrive. A common use for this chain is to apply redirect rules. Among the other answers, REDIRECT may appear valid but is in fact a target and not a chain. The other options shown are not valid.

**Example:**
To redirect traffic from port 80 to port 8080, use:

```bash
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080

### Question 87

Which of the following best describes the difference between the DROP and REJECT targets in iptables?

A. Both DROP and REJECT do the same thing.
B. DROP silently discards packets, while REJECT sends an ICMP acknowledgment.
C. REJECT silently discards message, while DROP sends an ICMP acknowledgment.
D. DROP sends back a direct message, and REJECT sens a redirect message.

<details>
<summary style="color: red;">Answer</summary>

B. DROP silently discards packets, while REJECT sends an ICMP acknowledgment.

**Explanation:**
The DROP target silently discards packets that match the rule. An ICMP unreachable message is sent back for REJECT. In general, DROP is preffered
in order to reduce the chances of denial of service (DoS) or other information-gathering issues. The other options are not valid.

**Example:**
To drop packets that match a rule, use:

```bash
iptables -A INPUT -s
```

</details>

### Question 88

Which of the following partial iptables rules sets up a configuration that limits log entries to threee per minute?

A. -m limit 3 -j LOG
B. -m limit --limit 3/minute --limit-burst 3 -j LOG
C. -m limit --limit 3
D. -m limit --limit-minute 3 --burst 3 -j LOG

<details>
<summary style="color: red;">Answer</summary>

B. -m limit --limit 3/minute --limit-burst 3 -j LOG

**Explanation:**
The -m match limit, along with the configuration options shown including the LOG target, creates the scenario described. There will be three log entries per minute. This can be useful to prevent denial
of service caused by filling up log files or overwhelming the server I/O while another attack is under way. The other options are not valid.

**Example:**
To limit log entries to three per minute, use:

```bash
iptables -A INPUT -m limit --limit 3/minute --limit-burst 3 -j LOG
```

</details>

### Question 89

Which of the following partial iptables rules allows incoming ICMP traffic?

A. -A INPUT -p ICMP -j ACCEPT
B. -A IN -P ICMP
C. -A INPUT -P ACCEPT -ICMP
D. -A IN -P ICMP -j ACCEPT

<details>
<summary style="color: red;">Answer</summary>

A. -A INPUT -p ICMP -j ACCEPT

**Explanation:**
The INPUT chain will be used. When used with the -A option, it will append a rule to the chain. The -p option specifies the protocol, ICMP in this case; the -j option specifies the target,
ACCEPT in this case. The -P option specifies a policy and will not be used for this scenario. The other options are not valid.

**Example:**
To allow incoming ICMP traffic, use:

```bash
iptables -A INPUT -p icmp -j ACCEPT
```

</details>

### Question 90

Which of the following partial iptables rules blocks all traffic from source IP 192.168.51.50?

A. -A INPUT -p ALL 192.168.51.50 -j ACCEPT
B. -A INPUT -p ALL -s 192.168.51.50 -j DROP
C. -A INPUT -p ALL -s 192.168.51.50 -j BLOCK
D. -A INPUT -p ALL -f 192.168.51.50 -j DISCARD

<details>
<summary style="color: red;">Answer</summary>

B. -A INPUT -p ALL -s 192.168.51.50 -j DROP

**Explanation:**
The INPUT chain will be used, and a rule needs to be appended with -A. The ALL option, when specifying a protocol, means all protocols will be included
in the rule. The -s option specifies the source, which in this case is a single IP address. Finally, the DROP target silently discards packets. There is no BLOCK
or DISCARD target, and the ACCEPT target will not block but will accept all traffic. The other options are not valid.

**Example:**
To block all traffic from a specific IP address, use:

```bash
iptables -A INPUT -p ALL -s 192.168.51.50 -j DROP
```

</details>

### Question 91

Which of the following partial iptables rules will allow all hosts to connect to TCP port 2222?

A. -A INPUT -p TCP -s 0/0 --destination-port 2222 -j ACCEPT
B. -A TCP -s ALL -p 2222 -j ACCEPT
C. -A INPUT -p TCP -s*.* --destination-port 2222 -j ALLOW
D. -A INPUT --destination-port _/_ -j ACCEPT

<details>
<summary style="color: red;">Answer</summary>

B. -A TCP -s ALL -p 2222 -j ACCEPT

**Explanation:**
A rule will be appended to the INPUT chain with -A. In this case, the protocol should be specified with -p TCP and a destination port of 2222. The source address indicated, 0/0, applies the rule to all hosts. The ACCEPT target will be used. The other options are not valid.

**Example:**
To allow all hosts to connect to TCP port 2222, use:

```bash
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 2222 -s 0.0.0.0/0 -j ACCEPT
```

B. echo "1" ? /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
C. iptables --enable-forwarding
D. ip-forward --enable

<details>
<summary style="color: red;">Answer</summary>

B. echo "1" ? /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

**Explanation:**
Echoing a 1 to the /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward file enables forwarding of IP packets. This is necessary in order to utilize NAT and for other uses.
There is a similar file for IPv6 at /proc/sys/net/ipv6/ip_forward. There is no /proc/sys/net/ipv4/nat file. The other options are not valid.

**Example:**
To enable IP forwarding, use:

```bash
echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
```

### Question 103

When you're working with PAM, a module that is marked as required has failed. Which of the following describes what happens to the other modules in that realm?

A. Processing stops immediately when a failure of a required module occurs.
B. Processing stops after all required modules are processed.
C. Processing continues until another required module is encountered.
D. Processing continues through other modules but ultimately fails.

<details>
<summary style="color: red;">Answer</summary>

D. Processing continues through other modules but ultimately fails.

**Explanation**
When a required module returns a failure, other modules continue to process, but the authentication ultimately fails. This is done so that logging will occur and other modules have had a chance to handle
the authentication attempt. If a failure should be immediate without processing other modules, then the requisite option should be used instead of required. The other options are not valid.
